👋 Hi, I’m Keldrick — a Blockchain Engineer building always-on financial systems.

I design and ship:
- Smart contract protocols (Solidity, Cadence)
- Event-driven backends & automation engines
- DeFi, tokenized assets, and capital infrastructure

Current focus:
- DeFi protocol architecture & yield systems
- On-chain / off-chain orchestration
- Blockchain-native financial primitives

Selected work:
- FlowBridge — real-time settlement + tokenized cash infrastructure
- BrickStack — fractional real estate & deal operating system
- FlowLend — Flow-native lending protocol
- Mini Exchange Engine — ATS-style matching engine prototype
